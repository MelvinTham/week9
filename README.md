# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

> Objective: Learn about Network Security by attacking and being attacked at vulnarable networked resources. Multiple Honey Pot VM instances were created to demonstrate it.

# Which HoneyPot(s) you deployed
  - mhn-honeypot-1 : dionaea
  - mhn-honeypot-2 : snort
  - mhn-honeypot-3 : dionaea
  
# Any issues you encountered
> I had to set up the VM's multiple times from scratch, which was really time consuming. 

# A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.

  1. Google Cloud Platform and HoneyPot set up.
     * I used the Google Cloud Platform to set up VM's (Ubuntu Trusty 14.04), installed MHN. 
     * One admin VM instance, three honeypot VM instances
     * GIFS:
